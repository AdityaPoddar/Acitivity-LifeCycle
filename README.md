# Activity lifecycle and state

Add code to the TwoActivities app from the previous practical to implement the various Activity lifecycle callbacks to include logging statements.
Observe the state changes as your app runs and as you interact with each Activity in your app.
Modify your app to retain the instance state of an Activity that is unexpectedly recreated in response to user behavior or configuration change on the device.
